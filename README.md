Choose from one of the two files. The first one is built using useReducer only, while the second one is built with useReducer and Context API. The file built with Context API is much cleaner and organized, but both work the same. You can compare the two codes to see the advantages of using the Context API method.

Additionally, you can choose to run the application using the JSON database file located in the folder or simulate a true API call using JSON Server. Just use the code provided in the file and execute "npm run server" and "npm start".
